## Introduction

Before testing can begin, every quality assurance (QA) team must have a structured guide ‚Äî the **Software Testing Plan**.  
A **Testing Plan** acts as a formal document that outlines the *scope, approach, resources, and schedule* for software testing activities.

It ensures that testing is organized, measurable, and aligned with project goals.  
This article summarizes key concepts presented by **Kelompok 3 Sistem Informasi 2023**, highlighting the **purpose, components, and structure** of a comprehensive Testing Plan according to the **IEEE 829-1988 standard**.

## What is a Testing Plan?

A **Testing Plan** is a reference document that explains **how software testing will be conducted**, including its **scope, strategy, resources, and timeline**.  

It serves as a **formal guideline** for QA teams, ensuring all activities are well-coordinated and consistent.

**Key Purposes:**
- Define what will be tested and how  
- Detect as many software defects as possible  
- Ensure software meets acceptable quality standards  
- Optimize time, cost, and human resources  
- Serve as documentation and evaluation for future projects

## Components of a Testing Plan (IEEE 829-1988)

According to the IEEE 829 standard, a testing plan should include these major components:

---

### 1. **Plan Identifier**
A unique ID or version number for each test plan to distinguish it from others.  
This helps with document management, version control, and referencing during revisions.

---

### 2. **References**
Lists of related documents, standards, or specifications that guide test plan creation ‚Äî ensuring consistency with project requirements.

---

### 3. **Introduction**
Serves as an executive summary. It outlines the **objectives**, **scope**, and **focus** of the testing process.  
This section helps stakeholders understand the purpose and direction of the test effort before going into technical details.

---

### 4. **Test Items**
Specifies the **software components, features, or modules** to be tested.  
It defines what will be included in the testing scope.

---

### 5. **Software Risk Issues**
Identifies potential risks that might affect software testing or performance.  
Examples include:
- Complex or newly developed modules  
- Integration with other versions  
- Ambiguous requirements  
- Misunderstood specifications  

---

### 6. **Features to Be Tested**
Describes the **functionalities** that will be tested from a user‚Äôs perspective, emphasizing their importance and associated risk levels.

---

### 7. **Features Not to Be Tested**
Lists the features excluded from testing and the reasons for exclusion.  
Common cases:
- Features already stable or previously tested  
- Modules not included in the current release  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Excluding high-risk features can increase the chance of failure in production.

---

### 8. **Testing Approach**
Defines the overall **strategy and methodology** to be used during testing.  

It answers these questions:
- What type of testing will be performed? (unit, integration, system, acceptance)  
- Which method is used? (manual or automated)  
- Which technique is applied? (black-box, white-box, or gray-box)  
- What is the main goal? (functional validation, performance, security, etc.)

---

### 9. **Item Pass/Fail Criteria**
Sets measurable standards for determining whether each test item passes or fails.  

**Pass Criteria:**
- All test cases run successfully  
- No critical defects found  
- Features function according to specifications  

**Fail Criteria:**
- One or more test cases fail  
- Critical defects block key functionalities  
- Behavior deviates from expected results  

---

### 10. **Suspension Criteria and Resumption Requirements**
Defines conditions to temporarily **stop** and **resume** testing.  

**Suspension Criteria:**  
Occurs when a serious issue halts testing progress (e.g., major bugs or system crashes).  

**Resumption Requirements:**  
Explain the conditions that must be met before testing can continue ‚Äî ensuring stability and efficiency.

---

### 11. **Test Deliverables**
Lists all documents and artifacts produced during testing, such as:
- Test plan  
- Test cases  
- Execution reports  
- Bug reports  
- Test summary reports  

These deliverables serve as proof that testing was performed thoroughly.

---

### 12. **Remaining Test Tasks**
Details unfinished or pending testing tasks that must be completed before project closure.

---

### 13. **Environmental Needs**
Specifies the hardware, software versions, test data, network configuration, and credentials required for valid and reproducible testing.

---

### 14. **Responsibilities**
Defines roles and responsibilities in the testing team ‚Äî including who coordinates, executes, verifies, and reports testing results.  
Clear task division prevents confusion and speeds up issue handling.

---

### 15. **Staffing and Training Needs**
Identifies required team members and competencies, such as **Test Managers**, **Testers**, and **Developers**.  
Training ensures everyone understands testing tools, objectives, and workflows.

---

### 16. **Schedule**
Outlines the **timeline** of testing activities ‚Äî from test planning and execution to re-testing and sign-off.  
Milestones typically include:
- Test case review  
- End-to-end testing  
- Final approval and release  

---

### 17. **Glossary**
A list of technical terms and acronyms used in the document to ensure consistent understanding among stakeholders.

---

### 18. **Approvals**
Lists the project stakeholders (Project Manager, QA Manager, etc.) who formally approve the test plan.  
It typically includes:
- Names  
- Roles  
- Signatures  
- Dates of approval  

---

## Summary

A **Software Testing Plan** provides a structured roadmap to ensure testing activities are efficient, organized, and aligned with project goals.  
It bridges the gap between **requirements and quality assurance**, ensuring all testing objectives are met within time and budget constraints.

---

## Conclusion

A well-crafted Testing Plan is essential for achieving **software quality and reliability**.  
It defines **what to test, how to test, who will test, and when to test**, ensuring the process is transparent and traceable.  
Following IEEE standards also enhances consistency across different projects and teams.
