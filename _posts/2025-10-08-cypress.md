## Introduction

In the world of modern web development, **Cypress** has emerged as one of the most powerful and intuitive testing frameworks for **end-to-end (E2E)** testing.  
It enables developers and testers to simulate real user interactions with the web application â€” ensuring the system behaves as expected across browsers.

This article summarizes the presentation from **Kelompok 8 Sistem Informasi 2023**, explaining what Cypress is, its features, setup steps, basic commands, and why it stands out from traditional testing tools like Selenium.

## What Is Cypress?

**Cypress** is a **modern end-to-end testing framework** for web applications, especially those built with **React**, **Vue**, **Angular**, and other modern front-end technologies.

It allows developers to write tests that run directly in the browser, providing real-time feedback as tests execute.

### Cypress in the Testing Pyramid

| Level | Description | Cypress Role |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| **Unit Testing** | Tests individual components or functions. | Can be integrated for component testing. |
| **Integration Testing** | Verifies how modules work together. | Supported by Cypress. |
| **End-to-End Testing (E2E)** | Simulates real user flow through the full app. | Cypress is primarily used here. |

Cypress primarily operates at the **End-to-End** level but can also handle **Integration** and **Component Testing** effectively.

## Installation and Setup

Before you begin, ensure **Node.js** is installed on your system.

### ðŸ”§ Steps to Install Cypress:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install cypress --save-dev
```
## Running Cypress
```bash
npx cypress open
```
This command opens the Cypress Test Runner, an interactive UI to manage and execute your test scripts.

To run tests directly in specific browsers:
```bash
npx cypress run --browser chrome
npx cypress run --browser firefox
npx cypress run --browser edge
```
## Basic Cypress Commands

Cypress provides easy-to-understand commands that mimic real user actions on a web page.
| Command               | Description                       | Example                                    |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `cy.visit('URL')`     | Opens a webpage.                  | `cy.visit('https://www.saucedemo.com')`    |
| `cy.get('selector')`  | Finds an element by selector.     | `cy.get('#username')`                      |
| `cy.type('text')`     | Types into an input field.        | `cy.get('#password').type('secret_sauce')` |
| `cy.click()`          | Simulates a button or link click. | `cy.get('#login-button').click()`          |
| `cy.contains('text')` | Finds element by visible text.    | `cy.contains('Add to cart')`               |
| `cy.url()`            | Gets the current page URL.        | `cy.url().should('include', '/inventory')` |
Cypress commands are asynchronous by design, meaning Cypress automatically waits for elements to appear â€” no need for manual wait() commands.

## Key Features of Cypress
Cypress is designed with a modern architecture that gives it a major advantage over older testing tools.
| Feature                     | Description                                                           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Modern Architecture**     | Built for modern web apps using JavaScript.                           |
| **Interactive Test Runner** | Visual test execution that displays each step in real-time.           |
| **Time Travel**             | Lets you see snapshots of your app at each test step.                 |
| **Automatic Waits**         | No need to add manual sleeps or delays â€” Cypress waits automatically. |
| **Real Browser Execution**  | Tests run inside the actual browser environment, not simulation.      |
| **Fast and Reliable**       | Optimized to run tests quickly without flakiness.                     |
These features make Cypress particularly effective for UI-based testing and real user simulations.

## Example Test Case
Scenario: Login Test on saucedemo.com
```javascript
describe('Login Functionality Test', () => {
  it('Should log in successfully with valid credentials', () => {
    cy.visit('https://www.saucedemo.com');
    cy.get('#user-name').type('standard_user');
    cy.get('#password').type('secret_sauce');
    cy.get('#login-button').click();

    // Verify redirection to inventory page
    cy.url().should('include', '/inventory');
  });

  it('Should show error message for invalid credentials', () => {
    cy.visit('https://www.saucedemo.com');
    cy.get('#user-name').type('wrong_user');
    cy.get('#password').type('wrong_password');
    cy.get('#login-button').click();

    cy.contains('Epic sadface').should('be.visible');
  });
});
```
This script tests both positive and negative login scenarios, verifying success and error message behavior.

## Why Cypress Is Different from Selenium
| Feature              | Cypress                            | Selenium                                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Architecture**     | Runs inside the browser.           | Operates outside via WebDriver.                 |
| **Setup**            | Simple (`npm install cypress`).    | Requires multiple drivers (e.g., ChromeDriver). |
| **Speed**            | Faster test execution.             | Slightly slower due to external communication.  |
| **Debugging**        | Real-time snapshots (Time Travel). | Relies on logs or screenshots.                  |
| **Language Support** | JavaScript only.                   | Multi-language (Java, Python, C#, etc.).        |

## Case Study: Login Automation with Cypress

In the live coding session, Kelompok 8 demonstrated an End-to-End test for the login process using the site https://www.saucedemo.com.

Test Results:
- Successful login â†’ Redirected to inventory page.
- Invalid credentials â†’ Displayed error message.
- Cypress Test Runner provided visual feedback for every test step.
This proved Cypressâ€™s ability to handle complex UI interactions easily while maintaining readable and maintainable test scripts.

## Conclusion

Cypress is a powerful and modern testing framework that simplifies the process of automating web application testing.
Its intuitive syntax, interactive test runner, and built-in features like Time Travel and Automatic Waits make it ideal for modern front-end applications.

Through the SauceDemo login case study, Cypress demonstrated its strength in simulating realistic user behavior for both positive and negative testing scenarios â€” helping developers ensure software reliability and quality.
