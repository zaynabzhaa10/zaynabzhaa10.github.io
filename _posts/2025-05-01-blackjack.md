## 🃏 Blackjack – Classic Card Game on the Web

This is a **simple web-based Blackjack game** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It replicates the basic mechanics of the traditional card game where you aim to get as close to 21 without going over.

Perfect as a small project for learning DOM manipulation and game logic in vanilla JavaScript.
