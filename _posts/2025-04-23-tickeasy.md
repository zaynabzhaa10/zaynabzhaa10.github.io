## 🎟️ What is TickEasy?

**TickEasy** is a simple and efficient **e-ticketing system** built with **Laravel**. It aims to simplify the process of ticket booking and management for events by offering a modern, responsive web interface and a reliable backend structure.

This project was developed as part of my learning journey in backend development using Laravel, with a focus on:

- Authentication & role management
- Ticket creation & booking flow
- Responsive and user-friendly interface
- CRUD operations with database integration
