## Introduction

In today‚Äôs digital ecosystem, applications often rely on **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** to communicate with one another.  
To ensure these connections work reliably, **API Testing** becomes a crucial process in software development.

This article summarizes the presentation by **Kelompok 6 Sistem Informasi 2023**, discussing what API testing is, why it matters, the tools commonly used (Postman & SOAPUI), and how requests and responses are structured within an API environment.

---

## üß† What Is API Testing?

**API Testing** is the process of validating an Application Programming Interface (API) to ensure it functions according to specifications.  
It verifies whether the API:
- Handles requests and responses properly,  
- Produces accurate outputs for given inputs, and  
- Maintains consistency under different usage scenarios.

Simply put, API testing ensures that systems can **communicate effectively and securely**.

---

## üéØ Why API Testing Is Important

APIs are the bridge between different software systems. Testing them ensures smooth communication, high reliability, and data accuracy.  
Here are several key benefits of API Testing:

| Benefit | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Ensures Functional Accuracy** | Confirms the API behaves according to design and produces correct outputs. |
| **Increases Reliability** | Detects bugs early, before integration. |
| **Improves Security** | Prevents unauthorized access and potential vulnerabilities. |
| **Measures Performance** | Tests API stability under heavy loads. |
| **Accelerates Development** | Automation reduces regression time. |
| **Supports System Integration** | Ensures multiple services can interact seamlessly. |

## üß∞ Popular Tools for API Testing

Modern API testing leverages specialized tools to automate and manage requests.  
The two most commonly used are **Postman** and **SOAPUI**.

---

### üß™ 1. Postman

**Postman** is a widely used, user-friendly tool designed for testing APIs ‚Äî both REST and GraphQL.  
It allows developers and testers to create, send, and monitor API requests easily.

#### üîë Key Features:
- Intuitive, user-friendly interface  
- Supports multiple HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)  
- Built-in authentication support  
- Environment and variable management  
- Request collections and documentation  
- Test automation and monitoring capabilities  
- Visualize API responses in JSON or XML

### ‚öôÔ∏è 2. SOAPUI

**SOAPUI** is a more advanced API testing tool suitable for enterprise-level scenarios and supports both **SOAP** (XML-based) and **REST** APIs.

#### üåü Key Features:
- Supports **Functional**, **Security**, and **Load Testing**  
- Data-driven testing (Excel or database integration)  
- Advanced test scenario creation for large-scale projects  
- Mock service creation to simulate API responses  
- Suitable for complex enterprise systems  

#### üí° Advantages:
| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Strong for SOAP-based APIs** | Best for testing legacy or enterprise systems using XML. |
| **Advanced Security Testing** | Identifies vulnerabilities and data leaks. |
| **Performance Testing Support** | Measures API speed and reliability under stress. |

## üîç Anatomy of API Request and Response

Understanding how requests and responses work is essential in API testing.

### ‚úâÔ∏è API Request Anatomy
A **Request** is a message sent by the client to the server to access or modify data.

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **HTTP Method (Verb)** | Defines the action to perform (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). |
| **URL (Endpoint)** | The address of the resource or API route being accessed. |
| **Headers** | Contain additional metadata (e.g., content type, authorization). |
| **Body** | Holds data sent to the server (usually in JSON or XML format). |

**Example Request (POST):**
```http
POST /api/users
Host: api.example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Zainab",
  "email": "zainab@example.com"
}
```

## API Response Anatomy

A Response is what the server sends back after processing a client request.
| Component       | Description                                                                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Status Code** | Indicates result (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error). |
| **Headers**     | Include response metadata such as content type and cache info.             |
| **Body**        | Contains the data returned by the API (often in JSON).                     |

Example Response (Success):
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "user_id": 101,
  "message": "User created successfully"
}
```
## Sending Requests Using Postman

Using Postman, testers can perform both GET and POST operations easily.

üßæ Example 1: GET Request

Open Postman and choose GET method.

Enter URL: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

Click Send.

Observe the list of user data returned in the Response Body.

üßæ Example 2: POST Request

1. Choose POST method.
2. Enter URL: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
3. Go to Body ‚Üí raw ‚Üí JSON.
4. Insert:
```json
{
  "title": "Belajar API Testing",
  "body": "Ini contoh POST request",
  "userId": 1
}
```
5. Click Send.
6. The API should return a confirmation with a generated ID.

Result:
Postman shows the response code (e.g., 201 Created) along with the new resource data ‚Äî verifying that the API works as expected.

## Live Coding Example

During the presentation, Kelompok 6 demonstrated API testing using a public API with both GET and POST requests.
The example showed how to:

- Send requests using Postman
- Validate response codes (200, 404, etc.)
- Interpret returned JSON data

This hands-on demonstration highlighted the importance of verifying API endpoints efficiently during development.

## Conclusion

API Testing is a vital step in ensuring that systems communicate efficiently, securely, and accurately.
It verifies data integrity, detects bugs early, and improves user experience through stable integrations.

By mastering tools such as Postman and SOAPUI, testers can automate, analyze, and validate API functionality effectively ‚Äî laying the foundation for robust, connected software systems.
