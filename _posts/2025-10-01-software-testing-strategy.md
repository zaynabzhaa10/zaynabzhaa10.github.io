## Introduction

Software development doesnâ€™t end after coding â€” it must go through a critical stage called **testing**.  
Testing ensures that the software functions as expected, is free from major bugs, and delivers a smooth user experience.  

This article explores **Software Testing Strategies**, summarizing key concepts from the presentation by *Kelompok 1 Sistem Informasi 2023*, which covers the importance, phases, and classifications of software testing within the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**.

## What is Software Testing?

**Software Testing** is the process of evaluating a software product to detect defects and ensure it meets both **functional** and **non-functional** requirements.  
Its primary purpose is to identify bugs before the software is released and to guarantee its reliability and quality.

---

## Objectives of Software Testing

- Verification and validation of software  
- Reduce failure risk  
- Improve stakeholder confidence  
- Ensure system security  
- Increase cost efficiency  
- Enhance user experience  

Testing plays a vital role in ensuring that software products perform as intended and provide long-term value.

## Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)

The **Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)** is a systematic process that ensures testing is structured, traceable, and measurable. Each phase has its own objective and deliverable.

### 1. Test Planning
Define the **testing strategy**, identify the **test environment**, estimate **time and cost**, assign responsibilities, and finalize the test plan.

### 2. Test Design
Create detailed **test cases**, prepare **test data**, define expected results, and validate coverage using a **Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)**.

### 3. Test Execution
Perform the planned test cases, log results, and classify outcomes as *passed, failed, or blocked*.

### 4. Reporting & Analysis
Summarize test results, identify defects, analyze severity, and recommend improvements for system performance, stability, or security.

## Classification of Software Testing

Software testing can be classified based on **abstraction level**, **function**, **domain**, and **structure**.

---

### Based on Abstraction

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Unit Testing** | Tests the smallest testable components such as functions or methods individually. | Verifying a discount function returns the correct result. |
| **Integration Testing** | Tests how different modules interact and communicate. | Checking if login and profile modules connect properly. |
| **System Testing** | Tests the system as a whole to ensure it meets all requirements. | Testing all e-commerce features under heavy load. |
| **Acceptance Testing** | Conducted by end-users or clients to validate that the system meets business needs. | Client approval before a mobile app launch. |

---

### Based on Function

| Type | Focus | Example |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Functional Testing** | Ensures the software performs required tasks correctly. | Testing login, password reset, and payment process. |
| **Non-Functional Testing** | Focuses on performance, reliability, and user experience rather than specific features. | Testing how a website performs during flash sales. |

---

### Based on Domain

| Type | Focus | Example |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Performance Testing** | Evaluates speed, responsiveness, and stability under load. | Measuring response time with 1000 concurrent users. |
| **Security Testing** | Identifies system vulnerabilities and prevents data breaches. | Detecting SQL injection or XSS risks. |
| **Usability Testing** | Evaluates user-friendliness and navigation ease. | Ensuring users can intuitively find and use app features. |

---

### Based on Structure

| Type | Description | Strengths | Limitations |
|------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| **Black-Box Testing** | Focuses on input-output behavior without knowing the internal code. | No technical knowledge required; end-user perspective. | Limited visibility into code; may miss internal logic bugs. |
| **White-Box Testing** | Focuses on internal code logic and paths. | Ensures full code coverage; uncovers hidden logic issues. | Requires programming knowledge; time-consuming for complex systems. |

## Importance of Testing in Software Development

Testing is not a one-time process â€” itâ€™s continuous throughout the SDLC.  
Its main purpose is to deliver **reliable, secure, and user-friendly software**.

Benefits include:
- Early detection of bugs and errors  
- Reduced development cost and time  
- Enhanced performance and scalability  
- Greater customer satisfaction and trust  

---

## Conclusion

Software Testing is an integral part of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**.  
A well-planned testing strategy ensures that the developed software is **error-free**, **secure**, and **user-oriented**.  
By applying the right testing types and strategies, teams can minimize risk and deliver high-quality applications that meet user expectations.
